# PubPol 475/750  --- Protest, Social Movements, Art, and Policy Change

This class explores political science and sociology research on how protests and movements affect policy, focusing on 20th and 21st-century movements in the United States. It covers opportunity structure, movement organizations, issue framing, coalition building, and the relationship between movements and political parties.  It also explores the role of movement art in policy change through creating and curating movement art, culminating in an exhibition at the end of the semester.

This is a small upper-level reading-intensive seminar that requires coming to class prepared to discuss the reading. There are no quizzes, exams, or prescriptive rubrics. Assessment is based on your thoughtful engagement with the ideas in the reading and with my feedback on your writing and art and on the articulation of research-based theories of change underlying your exhibitions.
