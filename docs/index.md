# PubPol 475/750  --- Protest, Social Movements, Art, and Policy Change

This class explores political science and sociology research on how protests and social movements affect policy, focusing on 20th and 21st-century movements in the United States. It covers opportunity structure, movement organizations, issue framing, coalition building, the relationships among movements and political parties, and the role of social movements in democracy.  It also explores the role of movement art in policy debates. Applying theories of policy change to a cause of their choosing, students will create and curate movement art, culminating in an exhibition at the end of the semester.

This is a small upper-level reading-intensive seminar that requires coming to class prepared to discuss the reading. There are no quizzes, exams, or prescriptive rubrics. Assessment is based on your ability to articulate research-based theories of change and thoughtful engagement with the ideas in the reading and with feedback on your writing and art. No skills or prior experience with art required.    

In 2026 and 2027, this class will be a collaboration with UMMA staff and their [American Ephemera](https://umma.umich.edu/blog/umma-and-the-labadie-collection-launch-ambitious-exhibition-series-on-american-protest-and-social-movements/) exhibit.
