#### PubPol 475/750  --- Protest, Social Movements, Art, and Policy Change

This new winter 2026 class explores political science and sociology research on how protests and social movements affect policy, focusing on 20th and 21st-century movements in the United States. It covers opportunity structure, movement organizations, issue framing, coalition building, the relationships among movements and political parties, and the role of social movements in democracy.  It also explores the role of movement art in policy debates. Applying theories of policy change to a cause of their choosing, students will create and curate movement art, culminating in an exhibition at the end of the semester.


This class will be a collaboration with UMMA staff and their [American Sampler](https://umma.umich.edu/blog/umma-and-the-labadie-collection-launch-ambitious-exhibition-series-on-american-protest-and-social-movements/) exhibit.
