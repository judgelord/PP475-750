    "text": "Tuesday/Thursday 1:00–2:20, 1210 Weill Hall\nInstructor: Devin Judge-Lord, judgelor@umich.edu, 715-204-4287\nThis class explores political science and sociology research on how protests and social movements affect policy, focusing on 20th and 21st-century movements in the United States. It covers opportunity structure, movement organizations, issue framing, coalition building, the relationships among movements and political parties, and the role of social movements in democracy. It also explores the role of movement art in policy debates. Applying theories of policy change to a cause of their choosing, students will create and curate movement art, culminating in an exhibition at the end of the semester.\nThis is a small upper-level reading-intensive seminar that requires coming to class prepared to discuss the reading. There are no quizzes, exams, or prescriptive rubrics. Assessment is based on your ability to articulate research-based theories of change and thoughtful engagement with the ideas in the reading and with feedback on your writing and art. No skills or prior experience with art required.\nIn 2026 and 2027, this class will be a collaboration with UMMA staff and their American Sampler exhibit.\nLinks to course resources:\n🚧 Syllabus updated: December 12 2025.

    "text": "∴ Course Philosophy\nIn designing this course, I proceed from several premises:\n\nIt is worth knowing the history of our current policy debates and the ideas and values that the rhetoric of these policy debates evokes.\nIt is more interesting to explore deeply rooted ideas and see them in rhetoric than to stay at the level of rhetoric. This class is about politics and policy as well as rhetoric and communications. I don’t want us to limit our thinking to what plays well in current mass media or elite discourse. I want you to develop a position on how you think politics should be reshaped. Then, let that inform your analysis of and contributions to political rhetoric.\nIndividual action is good but insufficient; collective action (and thus politics) is required. This class is in the public policy school, and I am a political scientist. We are here to learn about the many ways social movements impact (or fail to impact) policy, not argue about whether policy and politics, in general, are useful for solving problems."

    "text": "📜 Ford School and University of Michigan Policies\nFord School Inclusivity Statement: Members of the Ford School community represent a rich variety of backgrounds and perspectives. We are committed to providing an atmosphere for learning that respects diversity. While working together to build this community, we ask all members to:\n\nshare their unique experiences, values, and beliefs\nbe open to the views of others\nhonor the uniqueness of their colleagues\nappreciate the opportunity that we have to learn from each other in this community\nvalue one another’s opinions and communicate in a respectful manner\nkeep confidential discussions that the community has of a personal (or professional) nature\nuse this opportunity together to discuss ways in which we can create an inclusive environment in Ford - classes and across the UM community\n\nBeing a constructive member of a diverse community is always a learning process. The University has many resources to help us in this endeavor, including a glossary of terms.\nFord School Public Health Protection Policy. In order to participate in any in-person aspects of this course—including meeting with other students to study or work on a team project—you must follow all the public health safety measures and policies put in place by the State of Michigan, Washtenaw County, the University of Michigan, and the Ford School. Up-to-date information on U-M policies can be found on the U-M Health Response website. It is expected that you will protect and enhance the health of everyone in the Ford School community by staying home and following self-isolation guidelines if you are experiencing any symptoms of COVID-19.\nStudent Mental Health and Wellbeing. The University of Michigan is committed to advancing the mental health and wellbeing of its students. We acknowledge that a variety of issues, both those relating to the pandemic and other issues such as strained relationships, increased anxiety, alcohol/drug problems, and depression, can directly impact students’ academic performance and overall wellbeing. If you or someone you know is feeling overwhelmed, depressed, and/or in need of support, services are available.\nYou may access the Ford School’s embedded counselor, Paige Ziegler (pziegler@umich.edu), and/or counselors and urgent services at Counseling and Psychological Services (CAPS) and/or University Health Service (UHS). Students may also use the Crisis Text Line (text ‘4UMICH’ to 741741) to be connected to a trained crisis volunteer. You can find additional resources both on and off campus through the University Health Service and through CAPS.\nStudent/Faculty Interaction Best Practices. We strive to ensure a safe learning environment free from gender-based and sexual harassment, sexual violence, retaliation, and a hostile environment based on discrimination and intimidation. We make the following commitments:\n\nTo conduct office hours with the door open unless the student requests a closed-door meeting;\nTo document meeting times with students so that this record can be reviewed.\nTo meet students individually only at university venues;\nTo conduct off-campus meetings only at places where alcohol is not served;\nTo communicate electronically with students only on university platforms and not on social media, text, or non-university apps.\nFor more information on resources for reporting sexual misconduct, please see the faculty senate best practices for faculty interactions and U-M’s page on Sexual and Gender-Based Misconduct.\n\nAccommodations for Students with Disabilities:\nAccommodations for Students with Disabilities: The University of Michigan recognizes disability as an integral part of diversity and is committed to creating an inclusive and equitable educational environment for students with disabilities. Students who are experiencing a disability-related barrier should visit the Services for Students with Disabilities website. They can be reached at 734-763-3000 or ssdoffice@umich.edu. For students who are connected with SSD, accommodation requests can be made in Accommodate. If you have any questions or concerns, please contact your SSD Coordinator or visit SSD’s Current Student webpage. SSD considers aspects of the course design, course learning objects, and the individual academic and course barriers experienced by the student. Further conversation with SSD, instructors, and the student may be warranted to ensure an accessible course experience.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nIf you require accommodations from SSD, please start that process quickly because it takes time. \n\n\nAcademic Integrity: The Ford School academic community, like all communities, functions best when its members treat one another with honesty, fairness, respect, and trust. We hold all members of our community to high standards of scholarship and integrity. To accomplish its mission of providing an optimal educational environment and developing leaders of society, the Ford School promotes the assumption of personal responsibility and integrity and prohibits all forms of academic dishonesty, plagiarism, and misconduct. Academic dishonesty may be understood as any action or attempted action that may result in creating an unfair academic advantage for oneself or an unfair academic advantage or disadvantage for any other member or members of the academic community. Plagiarism involves representing the words, ideas, or work of others as one’s own in writing or presentations, and failing to give full and proper credit to the original source. Conduct, without regard to motive, that violates academic integrity and ethical standards will result in serious consequences and disciplinary action. The Ford School’s policy of academic integrity can be found in the MPP, BA, and Ph.D. Program handbooks. Additional information regarding academic dishonesty, plagiarism, and misconduct and their consequences is available at U-M’s academic-policies page.\nUse of Technology: Students should follow instructions from their instructor as to acceptable use of technology in the classroom, including laptops, in each course. All course materials (including slides, assignments, handouts, pre-recorded lectures, or recordings of class) are to be considered confidential material and are not to be shared in full or in part with anyone outside of the course participants. Likewise, your own personal recording (audio or video) of your classes or office hour sessions is allowed only with the express written permission of your instructor. If you wish to post course materials or photographs/videos of classmates or your instructor to third-party sites (e.g., social media), you must first obtain informed consent. Without explicit permission from the instructor and, in some cases, your classmates, the public distribution or posting of any photos, audio/video recordings, or pre-recordings from class, discussion section, or office hours, even if you have permission to record, is not allowed and could be considered academic misconduct.\nPlease review additional information and policies regarding academic expectations and resources at the Ford School of Public Policy.\nSee the end of the syllabus for information about our commitment to best practices of instructor/student interactions."

    "section": "️ Tools That Generate Text",
    "text": "️ Tools That Generate Text\nYou learn by doing work, and I assess your learning by the work you do. You may use tools to help craft your writing, but you must learn the crafts of constructive critique and persuasive writing to succeed in class. To add value to any employer or cause, you must craft arguments and recommendations that are significantly better than they would get by asking a SALAMI. I expect the same.\nText extruded by large language models (LLMs) is, by construction, derivative of patterns of words already linked together on the internet. In some sense, everything we do is derivative of our experiences, but the generative process is very different for thinking subjects (you) than for a pre-trained language model. Language models are [excellent at helping us conform to grammar conventions2 but incapable of producing original critiques. If they produce something that sounds insightful, it is only because we are able to assign meaning to the strings of words they extrude. (It also probably sounds right because it resembles things already written by a human on the internet.) Language models have no sense of meaning and cannot judge the consistency, coherence, or logic of an argument. I expect the work you produce to be yours and for you to stand by it as an intellectual project. No LLM can help you justify your thought process and reasoning. LLMs have no thought process and do not reason. Language is always in flux, but I see “reasoning” and “intelligence” are misnomers when applied to LLMs.\nBeyond grammar conventions, I am not yet sure if LLMs are a helpful tool for the craft of persuasive writing or for learning this craft. I worry that they may constrain creativity by focusing our attention on problems and solutions that already exist and have already been frequently linked in the source material on which the LLMs are trained. Additionally, in many fields, including political science, rich white men are disproportionately the authors of the source texts. Uncritically using LLMs trained on biased source material risks reproducing those biases.\nI basically agree with your colleague, Siena Beres, that the university pushing you all to use chatbots is very likely not all it is hyped up to be. Some shortcuts are helpful. Some cause you to miss out on the important parts of the journey.\nGood policy and political strategy rest on good evidence. LLMs can fabricate evidence. Even when the sources are real, unless it is an exact quote, LLMs cannot guarantee a reasonable link between a claim and a source (LLMs don’t reason), only a statistically probable word order. Extruded text is often sensible, but there is no guarantee. Be careful. Work submitted with fake sources or made-up facts will get a 0 for similar reasons that other forms of academic dishonesty make work worse than worthless. \nThus, references must be hyperlinked whenever possible; I will check to make sure sources of evidence are used appropriately.\nIf you use people or tools other than your brain and spelling/grammar checkers to string words together, you should be prepared to comment on what you used them for, what they got right, and what they got wrong.\nI reserve the right to discuss your papers in length with you if I have concerns that technological crutches are hindering your learning."

    "text": "🛠️ Tools That Generate Images\nI am more optimistic about the value of image-generating tools for this task because they require more thought and instruction from you. Like LLMs, they are essentially a tool of collage.\nYou are totally welcome to use image-generating tools at any step of your creative process.\nHowever, as the artist, you are responsible for understanding your source material. Thus, you should be able to comment on where the imagery is derived from and what it evokes. A reverse-image search of discrete portions of generated images may help you better understand the source material for the collage that a computer generated for you.\nYou will probably want to come up with any words you want to appear on your posters yourself (for reasons discussed above).\nPlease also be mindful of the environmental cost of computation. Many things we do affect other people and places. Using computers in data centers to generate images is likely one of the most impactful things you may do."

When there are multiple readings, you need not ask a question about every reading, but do focus on the more substantive readings. Quotes and citations don’t count toward the word limit.\nParticipate in class discussion. Attendance is required. You must let me know ahead of time if you must miss class.\nSummarize the discussion questions posed on Canvas for one class (2-3 minutes OR summarize what we have learned and how we have refined the points of debate at the end of one class (2-3 minutes)\n\nSign up to summarize questions or what we learned here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nDiscussion questions are graded on a 0-3 scale.\nAdvice on writing good questions from Professor Rohde:\nQuestions should model good intellectual practice; that is, not just a one-sentence question, but a few sentences providing some important framing or context. This could include, for example, an explanation of why the question is important (the stakes), an elaboration on the nuances of the question, etc. Reference to specific language in the text(s) is encouraged, and quotes are welcome. For material on the syllabus, simply cite the author and page; for materials beyond the syllabus, please include a full reference.\nTypes of questions:\n\nClarification/Comprehension (e.g., What does X mean? — This should not be answered with a quick internet search — an internet search yielding contradictory plausible answers is evidence that it is a good question)\nAnalytical/Interpretive (e.g., How does X evidence relate to Y point?)\nSynthetic/Evaluative (e.g., Are you convinced by the author’s argument that X? ) If you choose this question, be sure to say why the argument is provocative or has important implications. If you think a statement is obviously correct or trivial, then it is not worth discussing whether we agree with it.\nConnective/Comparative (e.g., How does X’s argument compare to Y’s we read last week?) If you choose this question, point us in the direction of some key similarities or differences.\nProvocative/Argumentative (e.g., Doesn’t evidence X undermine author’s point Y?!)\nApplied/Extended (e.g., Does X point help explain current problem Y?) If you choose this question, be sure to indicate why or how the comparison is relevant. I.e., don’t use this as a mindless invitation to extend an analysis across policy problems.\n\n\n\n\n\nMake-up policy\nYou get two days to take a pass on posting a discussion question and/or participating in class. Even if you are taking a pass on participation, I hope you will still come to class. If you are taking a pass and don’t want me to call you into the conversation, just let me know ahead of time.\nPass days will initially appear as “0” on Canvas, but I will adjust participation points when I calculate your final scores in Canvas.\nBeyond your two pass days, I allow you to make up two additional days:\n\nIf you know that you will miss class, write a 1-page reflection on the readings and share it with the class with your discussion post.\nIf you unexpectedly miss class, post a 1-page reflection on the readings **AND schedule a time to discuss the readings with me** (ideally, during office hours)\n\nBeyond four missed classes (two passes, two make-ups), I only allow make-ups in very extenuating circumstances. Participation is a core part of this class, and the entire class is deprived of your perspective when you are not with us."

I will never suggest a closed-door meeting myself because of the power dynamic.\nWe will document all pre-scheduled meetings between the instructor and the student via Google Calendar (or other software) and/or university email.\nStudents who email to request an office hour appointment should expect to receive an email confirmation or a Google Calendar (or other software) invitation from me, or, upon my email confirmation and request, may send me a Google Calendar (or other software) invitation for this meeting. The purpose is to provide a permanent record of the meeting and to ensure that all class activities are documented and transparent. Students who choose to drop by for informal meetings are welcome to do so, but there will be no documentation provided. (See above for open-door policy.)\nWe will choose meeting locations and conduct meetings with student and instructor safety in mind.\nWe will ensure that all individual meetings between the instructor/student will take place at university venues.\nWe will ensure that all off-campus meetings, trips, or events engage with the course material.\nOff-campus meetings will not involve alcohol or take place at locations that serve alcohol. If the class goes out for a meal, it will be at a cafe or restaurant that does not serve alcohol. The location/day/time of any off-campus meetings between the instructor and students will be documented in Google Calendar (or other software).\nWe, the instructors, will conduct all individual communications using the University platforms of email, Canvas, Slack, or Piazza, with the caveat that we may use non-university platforms set up by students (such as GroupMe) only if they include all students in the class.\nThere will be no instructor-student private communications on any non-University platforms, such as social media, GroupMe, WhatsApp, etc.\nFor more information on resources for reporting sexual misconduct, please see the faculty senate best practices for faculty interactions and U-M’s page on Sexual and Gender-Based Misconduct."

    "text": "Interest Groups & Social Movements\nMW, 2:00-3:15 p.m.\nWalsh 396\nGeorgetown University\nSpring 2024\nProfessor: Dr. Maraam Dwidar Office: ICC 589\nEmail: md1921@georgetown.edu Office Hours: W, 12:30-1:30 p.m.\nCourse Description:\nIn this course, we will examine the role of political advocacy organizations and social movements in American politics. We will explore theoretical and empirical research on the topic of organized interests and collective action, paying particular attention to organizational advocates and movements that represent people united by a common, vulnerable, identity (e.g., race, class, gender, sexuality, etc.). We will examine the nature and extent of organized interests’ participation in national politics, the mechanisms of interest group – and social movement – formation and maintenance, representation and bias in political organizations and movements, the tactics and targets of organizations and organizers, the effectiveness of “outsider” versus “insider” strategies over governmental priorities and policy outputs, and more.\nWe will consider — with a critical eye — questions such as: What is the difference between a political advocacy group and a social movement? How do the foundations of American institutional design facilitate organized interest group formation and influence? Who joins interest groups — and who participates in social movements — and why? Why types of interests are represented by groups and movements? When do organized interests succeed in influencing government? When do they fail? In doing so, we will develop a series of analytic tools and skills to evaluate and communicate political research and trends. Thus, the core of this course will consist of an in-depth research project that will require you to make practical use of our course content. I encourage you to use this project as an opportunity to become an expert in a political or policy area of interest to you, and to develop your critical thinking, writing, and social science research skills.\nOur classes will mainly consist of lectures and presentations, but the course is also designed to allow for significant discussion time. Thus, I expect you to come to class ready to discuss the assigned readings and answer questions. If you do not participate of your own initiative, be prepared to be called on. If assignments or readings are confusing, come with questions! The more you participate, the more enriching the class will be and the easier it will be for you to learn.\nA syllabus is like a contract, so in the coming pages, I have specified many details, some in fairly strict language. Please do not be alarmed. We will read and do a variety of very interesting things and you will learn a lot. I am excited to teach this material and am looking forward to each week of what follows. I genuinely hope it will be one of the best courses you ever take.\nCourse Expectations:\nI expect you to abide by the following classroom etiquette. Your participation grade will, in part, re flect your ability to follow the expectations set forth below. Please refer to this list of expectations as needed throughout the semester.\n1\nu Canvas: All information for this course can be accessed on the Georgetown University Canvas page for this course. To access the Canvas page, go to this link, log in, and select the tab for GOVT 3418.\nu Email: I welcome email questions and comments. However, when you write to me, you should compose your email as you would any piece of professional correspondence. Specifically:\n• Begin the email with a salutation (e.g., “Dear Dr. Dwidar” or “Hi Professor Dwidar”). It is not appropriate to email without a salutation, and “Hey” does not count.\n• Use a capital letter to start the first word of each sentence and every proper noun.\n• Use complete sentences, correct spelling, and correct punctuation. • Be courteous and respectful.\n• At the bottom of the email, sign off with either “Sincerely,” or “Best,” or the equivalent, and below this line write your first and last name in your first email and then just your first name thereafter.\n• Include the title of our course (GOVT 3418) below your name (and/or in the subject line of the email).\nI will respond to your emails as quickly as possible, but you should not expect an answer on the same day to an email sent on weekends or after 5:00 p.m on any weekday. Importantly, I will not respond to emails regarding assignments or exams in the 24 hour period before they are due or scheduled to take place. Please plan ahead, and I will be more than happy to assist.\nu Office Hours: My office hours are your time to come speak with me about our class, be it to clarify material, discuss your performance, or talk about other related academic or professional subjects. Please feel welcome to stop by and chat at any point in the semester. I would love nothing more than to get to know you so that I can better cater to your learning interests and needs. If you are unable to visit my office hours due to scheduling constraints, please reach out to me to make an appointment – I will be happy to accommodate.\nu Lecture Slides: Lecture slides will be available on Canvas by the morning of a given lecture. Be warned that the material on the slides usually does not include all the important information we will cover in class. The slides are designed to help structure your note-taking and studying – not to replace it. Thus, I encourage you to attend class each day. If you miss a class, I encourage you to talk with a fellow student to get filled in on what you missed.\n2\nu Talking in Class: I hope that we will have many enriching class\ndiscussions, and that you will feel welcome and excited to contribute.\nWhen you do contribute, please do so loudly so that others can hear you.\nAdditionally, please be aware of how much you are speaking. I apply the\n“stand up, step back” guideline in all of my classes. This means that if\nyou are not speaking, I may encourage you to contribute some comments,\nideas, or suggestions (“stand up”), and if you are speaking a lot, I may\nencourage you to allow others the space to speak (“step back”). I will also\nnot tolerate interruptions of any kind, particularly toward your fellow\nclassmates. If you are nervous about speaking up in class, please come talk\nto me – we can brainstorm strategies to help you confidently contribute.\nu Staying in Touch: We all experience hardships that can make it\ndifficult to do our jobs from time to time. If you are having a difficult time\nkeeping up with classwork due to some personal hardship, please come talk\nto me. I will be more than happy to work with you to make sure that you\nremain afloat in class whilst taking the time to address your personal\nneeds. Do not feel as though you will need to divulge private information\nto me – just keep me broadly in the loop, and I’ll do what I can to make\nsure you are supported in our classroom.\nRequired Materials:\nThis material is available on reserve in physical and electronic form at the library, at the campus book store, and in new or used form on the internet. All other assigned readings will be scanned and uploaded to Canvas at least one week prior to the class date they correspond to.\n• Berry, Jeffrey and Clyde Wilcox. 2018. The Interest Group Society. 5th Edition. Pearson Publishing.\n• Goodwin, Jeff and James Jasper. 2014. The Social Movements Reader. 3rd Edition.

Do not assume that you will receive full marks for your participation grade automatically; you must earn every point yourself. Carefully review the assigned readings, come to class, participate in class discussions, invest in your research project, and you will earn a good participation grade.\nResearch Project:\nYour research project for the semester will consist of two parts: writing a research paper and present ing the findings of your paper to the class at the conclusion of the semester. This project will be guided by two smaller assignments – a research paper proposal and a research paper draft – to be completed in the first and second thirds of the semester. Complete descriptions of the expectations for this project will be posted on Canvas. You are responsible for staying in touch with me throughout the semester about your progress on this project, especially if you experience any difficulties.\nu Research Paper: The first component of this assignment will ask you\nto identify an American social movement or political organization of\ninterest to you and historicize its development by discussing its origins,\ngoals, structure, characteristics, tactics, major players/partners, and\nachievements to date. In doing so, you will make an argument for whether,\nand to what degree, this movement or organization has been successful –\nand offer recommendations for how movement/organization leaders might\nimprove upon their strategies to organize collectively. You must reference\nconcepts and readings from our class lectures and curriculum as\njustification for your argument. This paper should be approximately 15-20\npages, double spaced, and should include at least ten sources – six of which\nmust be academic sources. This assignment will be due at the\nconclusion of our final exam period – 2:30 p.m. – on May 11.\nu Research Presentation: The second component of this assignment will\nask you to prepare and deliver a short presentation to the class\nsummarizing the findings of your research paper. This presentation should\nbe approximately 5-7 minutes in length and should include visual aids\n(e.g., slides). As with the research paper, this presentation should\ndemonstrate mastery of our class material; concepts, theories, and\nexamples from our lectures and readings should be incorporated, as\nappropriate. Presentations will take place in the last week and a\nhalf of the semester.\nExams:\nYou will complete two exams over the course of the semester. They will contain a mix of short answer and essay questions. Both exams will be taken in-class and will be closed-note. I will provide all necessary exam materials – all you will need to do is bring a pen or pencil.\nShort of extraordinary circumstances, you will not be allowed to make up the exams. If you have planned circumstances that you believe qualify as extraordinary (e.g., a non-flexible academic or athletic commit ment), you must contact me regarding these circumstances at least two weeks in advance of the exam date. Otherwise, you will only be allowed to make up an exam in the event of extreme and unpredictable\n4\ncircumstances and then only if you provide documentation verifying the circumstances that made it im possible for you to take the exam as scheduled. Make up exams will not be offered for students who have already taken the exam in question (in other words – you cannot request a “make up” exam for an exam that you have already taken, under any circumstances).\nLate Assignments:\nAll assignments must be submitted on time for consideration for full credit. In the absence of extreme circumstances (with documentation), assignments turned in after the due date will be accepted but marked down five percentage points (i.e., one half letter grade) for each 24 hours or portion thereof after the dead line, including weekends, holidays, school breaks, etc. For example, an assignment due Monday at 2:00 pm but not turned in until sometime between 2:00 pm on Wednesday and 2:00 pm on Thursday of the same week would be marked down 15% (one and a half letter grades) below the earned grade (e.g., from a 90% (A-) to a 75% (C)).\nGrade Appeals:\nYou may appeal a grade by submitting a written request to me in two forms, both electronically and in hard-copy. Appeals are due within five days of receiving the grade in question. Your written appeal should explain, in logical and concise (and polite) terms, why you believe you should have received a differ ent grade. I will take all grade appeals seriously, but be warned that once you appeal a grade I will reconsider that grade with an open mind, and re-grades can happen in either direction. If this re-evaluation reveals that you deserved a higher grade than you received, your grade will be changed in your favor. But if this process reveals that you deserved a lower grade than you received, your grade will be changed downward. If your original grade is deemed correct, your grade will remain the same. I will only consider one grade appeal per assignment/exam, and will not negotiate after a final decision is made.\nAcademic Integrity Policy:\nAll students are expected to maintain the highest standards of academic and personal integrity in pur suit of their education at Georgetown. Academic dishonesty, including plagiarism, in any form is a serious offense, and students found in violation are subject to academic penalties that include, but are not limited to, failure of the course, termination from the program, and revocation of degrees already conferred. This policy additionally applies to work taken directly from an AI generator and to work that has been paraphrased by AI before being used in coursework. A simple rule of thumb is the following: if you did not generate the words yourself, you should quote and cite the source; if you generated the words but not the content and ideas, you should still quote and cite the source. More broadly, all students are held to the Georgetown University Honor System, available here.\nAttendance Policy:\nYour presence in class is enormously valuable; most of our learning will take place in the conversations we have during these sessions. Thus, I encourage you to attend every class session. That said, I understand that life is unpredictable and that you may need to be absent from time to time. For these reasons, I will not take attendance or grade on the basis of attendance in our class. However, if you are unable to consistently attend our class meetings, please come speak with me.\nDisability Accommodations and Student Support:\nIf you have a disability that may affect your academic work or well-being and for which accommodations may be necessary, I encourage you to approach me within the first two weeks of the course (or, in other circum stances, as soon as possible after accommodation becomes necessary) so that I can arrange for your needs to\n5\nbe met in this regard. You will also need to contact the Academic Resource Center, located in Leavey Center.\nThere are also many general resources on campus available to students for support throughout their time at Georgetown, covering physical and mental well-being. You can find a comprehensive brochure listing these resources here.\nPersonal Pronoun Preference:\nOne of the central tenets of Georgetown’s educational mission is cura personalis, a Latin phrase mean ing “care of the whole person.” Georgetown is committed to showing care and concern for each student by creating an inclusive and accessible learning environment that follows universal design principles to meet the needs of its diverse student body. Respecting a person’s choice of name and pronouns is an important aspect of care of the whole person and creates a culture of inclusion in learning spaces that has benefits for all learners.\nI am committed to creating a learning environment for my students that supports a diversity of thoughts, perspectives, and experiences, and honors your identities (including race, gender, class, sexuality, religion, ability, etc.). Thus, while class rosters are provided to the instructor with the student’s legal name, I will gladly honor your request to address you by an alternate name or pronoun. If your name or pronoun needs to be corrected, please let me know early in the semester so that I can make the appropriate changes to my records.\nReligious Holidays:\nGeorgetown University promotes respect for all religions. Any student who is unable to attend classes or to participate in any examination, presentation, or assignment on a given day because of the observance of a major religious holiday or related travel shall be excused and provided with the opportunity to make up, without unreasonable burden, any work that has been missed for this reason and shall not in any other way be penalized for the absence or rescheduled work. Students will remain responsible for all assigned work. Please notify me in writing at the beginning of the semester of any religious observances that will conflict with our class.\nInstructional Continuity:\nIf campus is closed for any reason, please make sure to check your email. I will be in touch with in structions on where to find materials for continuing class instruction. This may include additional readings, video or audio files, and/or writing assignments. More information can be found here.\nUse of Class Materials and Recordings:\nOriginal class materials (handouts, assignments, tests, etc.) and recordings of class sessions are the in tellectual property of the course instructor. You may download these materials for your use in this class. However, you may not provide these materials to any third party (e.g., websites such as Coursicle, Chegg, and so on), other students, or disseminate them via social media without my permission. Doing so is a violation of intellectual property law and of the student code of conduct.\nCourse Outline:\nJanuary 10: Course Introduction\n• Syllabus\n• How to Read Political Science: A Guide in Four Steps\n6\nJanuary 15: Martin Luther King, Jr. Day\n• No class\nJanuary 17: Foundations and Frameworks\n• The Interest Group Society, Chapter 1\n• The Social Movements Reader, Editors’ Introduction\n• Madison, James. 1787.

    "text": "Navigating a discussion-based course about politics can be challenging. People have strong opinions about politics. Some may have expertise in particular areas; sometimes, even those same people can feel overwhelmed in other conversations. My goal in this course is to provide you with conceptual tools, critical thinking skills, and models to help you better understand and participate in politics and policymaking. This will be most effective if we can create a “brave space” that allows each of you to participate “fully and truthfully”, take risks, and listen to and be empathetic toward one another.\nTo facilitate a productive seminar, we will start by thinking critically about the benefits and limitations of political civility and developing best practices for the semester.\n\nWhat have your most positive classroom experiences been (especially for discussion-based courses)? What made those experiences so positive, and how might that be recreated elsewhere?\nThink of a negative classroom experience you have had. What might the instructor, other students, and you have done differently to improve it?\nWhat worries you most about managing the course this term? Do you have ideas on how we might manage them?\nWhat might be the most effective strategies for managing dialogue across difference?\nAre there drawbacks to maintaining political civility?\n\nBrian Arao and Kristi Clemens suggest:\n\n“We argue that authentic learning about social justice often requires the very qualities of risk, difficulty, and controversy that are defined as incompatible with safety. These challenges are particularly unavoidable in participant groups composed of target and agent group members. In such settings, target and agent group members take risks by participating fully and truthfully, though these risks differ substantially by group membership and which identities hold the most salience for a given participant at a given time.”\n\nWe aim towards civility but also understand that civility has its limitations and can sometimes prevent honesty and true expressions of emotion and responsibility. Civility is also easier to achieve from a position of privilege. Nevertheless, I see that as a potentially productive tension, one which may help us all learn more as the semester progresses.\n\n\n\nThe professor commits to support student learning, including by:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStudents commit to practice active listening and engagement, including by:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo maintain successful and respectful relationships between students and the professor:"
