    "text": "Tuesday/Thursday 1:00–2:20, 1210 Weill Hall\nInstructor: Devin Judge-Lord, judgelor@umich.edu, 715-204-4287\nThis class explores political science and sociology research on how protests and social movements affect policy, focusing on 20th and 21st-century movements in the United States. It covers opportunity structure, movement organizations, issue framing, coalition building, the relationships among movements and political parties, and the role of social movements in democracy. It also explores the role of movement art in policy debates. Applying theories of policy change to a cause of their choosing, students will create and curate movement art, culminating in an exhibition at the end of the semester.\nThis is a small upper-level seminar that requires coming to class prepared to discuss the reading. No skills or prior experience with art required. There are no quizzes or exams. Assessment is based on your ability to articulate research-based theories of change and thoughtful engagement with the ideas in the reading and with feedback on your writing and art.\nIn 2026 and 2027, this class will be a collaboration with UMMA staff and their American Sampler exhibit, and our class will meet at the museum during class time on several occasions throughout the semester.\nLinks to course resources:\n🚧 Syllabus updated: January 20 2026.

    "text": "∴ Course Philosophy\nIn designing this course, I proceed from several premises:\n\nIt is worth knowing the history of our current policy debates and the ideas and values that the rhetoric of these policy debates evokes.\nIt is more interesting to explore deeply rooted ideas and see them in rhetoric than to stay at the level of rhetoric. This class is about politics and policy as well as rhetoric and communications. I don’t want us to limit our thinking to what plays well in current mass media or elite discourse. I want you to develop a position on how you think politics should be reshaped. Then, let that inform your analysis of and contributions to political rhetoric.\nIndividual action is good but insufficient; collective action (and thus politics) is required. This class is in the public policy school, and I am a political scientist. We are here to learn about the many ways social movements impact (or fail to impact) policy, not argue about whether policy and politics, in general, are useful for solving problems."

    "text": "📜 Ford School and University of Michigan Policies\nFord School Inclusivity Statement: Members of the Ford School community represent a rich variety of backgrounds and perspectives. We are committed to providing an atmosphere for learning that respects diversity. While working together to build this community, we ask all members to:\n\nshare their unique experiences, values, and beliefs\nbe open to the views of others\nhonor the uniqueness of their colleagues\nappreciate the opportunity that we have to learn from each other in this community\nvalue one another’s opinions and communicate in a respectful manner\nkeep confidential discussions that the community has of a personal (or professional) nature\nuse this opportunity together to discuss ways in which we can create an inclusive environment in Ford - classes and across the UM community\n\nBeing a constructive member of a diverse community is always a learning process. The University has many resources to help us in this endeavor, including a glossary of terms.\nFord School Public Health Protection Policy. In order to participate in any in-person aspects of this course—including meeting with other students to study or work on a team project—you must follow all the public health safety measures and policies put in place by the State of Michigan, Washtenaw County, the University of Michigan, and the Ford School. Up-to-date information on U-M policies can be found on the U-M Health Response website. It is expected that you will protect and enhance the health of everyone in the Ford School community by staying home and following self-isolation guidelines if you are experiencing any symptoms of COVID-19.\nStudent Mental Health and Wellbeing. The University of Michigan is committed to advancing the mental health and wellbeing of its students. We acknowledge that a variety of issues, both those relating to the pandemic and other issues such as strained relationships, increased anxiety, alcohol/drug problems, and depression, can directly impact students’ academic performance and overall wellbeing. If you or someone you know is feeling overwhelmed, depressed, and/or in need of support, services are available.\nYou may access the Ford School’s embedded counselor, Paige Ziegler (pziegler@umich.edu), and/or counselors and urgent services at Counseling and Psychological Services (CAPS) and/or University Health Service (UHS). Students may also use the Crisis Text Line (text ‘4UMICH’ to 741741) to be connected to a trained crisis volunteer. You can find additional resources both on and off campus through the University Health Service and through CAPS.\nStudent/Faculty Interaction Best Practices. We strive to ensure a safe learning environment free from gender-based and sexual harassment, sexual violence, retaliation, and a hostile environment based on discrimination and intimidation. We make the following commitments:\n\nTo conduct office hours with the door open unless the student requests a closed-door meeting;\nTo document meeting times with students so that this record can be reviewed.\nTo meet students individually only at university venues;\nTo conduct off-campus meetings only at places where alcohol is not served;\nTo communicate electronically with students only on university platforms and not on social media, text, or non-university apps.\nFor more information on resources for reporting sexual misconduct, please see the faculty senate best practices for faculty interactions and U-M’s page on Sexual and Gender-Based Misconduct.\n\nAccommodations for Students with Disabilities:\nAccommodations for Students with Disabilities: The University of Michigan recognizes disability as an integral part of diversity and is committed to creating an inclusive and equitable educational environment for students with disabilities. Students who are experiencing a disability-related barrier should visit the Services for Students with Disabilities website. They can be reached at 734-763-3000 or ssdoffice@umich.edu. For students who are connected with SSD, accommodation requests can be made in Accommodate. If you have any questions or concerns, please contact your SSD Coordinator or visit SSD’s Current Student webpage. SSD considers aspects of the course design, course learning objects, and the individual academic and course barriers experienced by the student. Further conversation with SSD, instructors, and the student may be warranted to ensure an accessible course experience.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nIf you require accommodations from SSD, please start that process quickly because it takes time. \n\n\nAcademic Integrity: The Ford School academic community, like all communities, functions best when its members treat one another with honesty, fairness, respect, and trust. We hold all members of our community to high standards of scholarship and integrity. To accomplish its mission of providing an optimal educational environment and developing leaders of society, the Ford School promotes the assumption of personal responsibility and integrity and prohibits all forms of academic dishonesty, plagiarism, and misconduct. Academic dishonesty may be understood as any action or attempted action that may result in creating an unfair academic advantage for oneself or an unfair academic advantage or disadvantage for any other member or members of the academic community. Plagiarism involves representing the words, ideas, or work of others as one’s own in writing or presentations, and failing to give full and proper credit to the original source. Conduct, without regard to motive, that violates academic integrity and ethical standards will result in serious consequences and disciplinary action. The Ford School’s policy of academic integrity can be found in the MPP, BA, and Ph.D. Program handbooks. Additional information regarding academic dishonesty, plagiarism, and misconduct and their consequences is available at U-M’s academic-policies page.\nUse of Technology: Students should follow instructions from their instructor as to acceptable use of technology in the classroom, including laptops, in each course. All course materials (including slides, assignments, handouts, pre-recorded lectures, or recordings of class) are to be considered confidential material and are not to be shared in full or in part with anyone outside of the course participants. Likewise, your own personal recording (audio or video) of your classes or office hour sessions is allowed only with the express written permission of your instructor. If you wish to post course materials or photographs/videos of classmates or your instructor to third-party sites (e.g., social media), you must first obtain informed consent. Without explicit permission from the instructor and, in some cases, your classmates, the public distribution or posting of any photos, audio/video recordings, or pre-recordings from class, discussion section, or office hours, even if you have permission to record, is not allowed and could be considered academic misconduct.\nPlease review additional information and policies regarding academic expectations and resources at the Ford School of Public Policy.\nSee the end of the syllabus for information about our commitment to best practices of instructor/student interactions."

    "section": "️ Tools That Generate Text",
    "text": "️ Tools That Generate Text\nYou learn by doing work, and I assess your learning by the work you do. You may use tools to help craft your writing, but you must learn the crafts of constructive critique and persuasive writing to succeed in class. To add value to any employer or cause, you must craft arguments and recommendations that are significantly better than they would get by asking a SALAMI. I expect the same.\nText extruded by large language models (LLMs) is, by construction, derivative of patterns of words already linked together on the internet. In some sense, everything we do is derivative of our experiences, but the generative process is very different for thinking subjects (you) than for a pre-trained language model. Language models are [excellent at helping us conform to grammar conventions2 but incapable of producing original critiques. If they produce something that sounds insightful, it is only because we are able to assign meaning to the strings of words they extrude. (It also probably sounds right because it resembles things already written by a human on the internet.) Language models have no sense of meaning and cannot judge the consistency, coherence, or logic of an argument. I expect the work you produce to be yours and for you to stand by it as an intellectual project. No LLM can help you justify your thought process and reasoning. LLMs have no thought process and do not reason. Language is always in flux, but I see “reasoning” and “intelligence” are misnomers when applied to LLMs.\nBeyond grammar conventions, I am not yet sure if LLMs are a helpful tool for the craft of persuasive writing or for learning this craft. I worry that they may constrain creativity by focusing our attention on problems and solutions that already exist and have already been frequently linked in the source material on which the LLMs are trained. Additionally, in many fields, including political science, rich white men are disproportionately the authors of the source texts. Uncritically using LLMs trained on biased source material risks reproducing those biases.\nI basically agree with your colleague, Siena Beres, that the university pushing you all to use chatbots is very likely not all it is hyped up to be. Some shortcuts are helpful. Some cause you to miss out on the important parts of the journey.\nGood policy and political strategy rest on good evidence. LLMs can fabricate evidence. Even when the sources are real, unless it is an exact quote, LLMs cannot guarantee a reasonable link between a claim and a source (LLMs don’t reason), only a statistically probable word order. Extruded text is often sensible, but there is no guarantee. Be careful. Work submitted with fake sources or made-up facts will get a 0 for similar reasons that other forms of academic dishonesty make work worse than worthless. \nThus, references must be hyperlinked whenever possible; I will check to make sure sources of evidence are used appropriately.\nIf you use people or tools other than your brain and spelling/grammar checkers to string words together, you should be prepared to comment on what you used them for, what they got right, and what they got wrong.\nI reserve the right to discuss your papers in length with you if I have concerns that technological crutches are hindering your learning."

    "text": "🛠️ Tools That Generate Images\nI am more optimistic about the value of image-generating tools for this task because they require more thought and instruction from you. Like LLMs, they are essentially a tool of collage.\nYou are totally welcome to use image-generating tools at any step of your creative process.\nHowever, as the artist, you are responsible for understanding your source material. Thus, you should be able to comment on where the imagery is derived from and what it evokes. A reverse-image search of discrete portions of generated images may help you better understand the source material for the collage that a computer generated for you.\nYou will probably want to come up with any words you want to appear on your posters yourself (for reasons discussed above).\nPlease also be mindful of the environmental cost of computation. Many things we do affect other people and places. Using computers in data centers to generate images is likely one of the most impactful things you may do."

Late posts are not counted. Posts should be no more than 150 words and include (1) a one-sentence summary of  Your understanding of the argument(s) relevant to your question(s), (2) What you think about the argument(s), AND (3) Question(s) about the reading(s) that merit further discussion.  When there are multiple readings, you need not ask a question about every reading, but do focus on the more substantive readings. Quotes and citations don’t count toward the word limit.\nParticipate in class discussion. Attendance is required. You must let me know ahead of time if you must miss class.\nSummarize the discussion questions posed on Canvas for one class (2-3 minutes)\nSummarize what we have learned and how we have refined the points of debate at the end of one class (2-3 minutes)\n\nSign up to summarize questions or what we learned here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nDiscussion questions are graded on a 0-3 scale.\nAdvice on writing good questions from Professor Rohde:\nQuestions should model good intellectual practice; that is, not just a one-sentence question, but a few sentences providing some important framing or context. This could include, for example, an explanation of why the question is important (the stakes), an elaboration on the nuances of the question, etc. Reference to specific language in the text(s) is encouraged, and quotes are welcome. For material on the syllabus, simply cite the author and page; for materials beyond the syllabus, please include a full reference.\nTypes of questions:\n\nClarification/Comprehension (e.g., What does X mean? — This should not be answered with a quick internet search — an internet search yielding contradictory plausible answers is evidence that it is a good question)\nAnalytical/Interpretive (e.g., How does X evidence relate to Y point?)\nSynthetic/Evaluative (e.g., Are you convinced by the author’s argument that X? ) If you choose this question, be sure to say why the argument is provocative or has important implications. If you think a statement is obviously correct or trivial, then it is not worth discussing whether we agree with it.\nConnective/Comparative (e.g., How does X’s argument compare to Y’s we read last week?) If you choose this question, point us in the direction of some key similarities or differences.\nProvocative/Argumentative (e.g., Doesn’t evidence X undermine author’s point Y?!)\nApplied/Extended (e.g., Does X point help explain current problem Y?) If you choose this question, be sure to indicate why or how the comparison is relevant. I.e., don’t use this as a mindless invitation to extend an analysis across policy problems.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMake-up policy\nYou get two days to take a pass on posting a discussion question and/or participating in class. Even if you are taking a pass on participation, I hope you will still come to class. If you are taking a pass and don’t want me to call you into the conversation, just let me know ahead of time.\nBeyond your two pass days, you may make up two additional days:\n\nIf you know that you will miss class, write a 1-page reflection on the readings and share it with the class with your discussion post.\nIf you unexpectedly miss class, post a 1-page reflection on the readings **AND schedule a time to discuss the readings with me** (ideally, during office hours)\n\nBeyond four missed classes (two passes, two make-ups), I only allow make-ups in very extenuating circumstances. Participation is a core part of this class, and the entire class is deprived of your perspective when you are not with us."

If the class goes out for a meal, it will be at a cafe or restaurant that does not serve alcohol. The location/day/time of any off-campus meetings between the instructor and students will be documented in Google Calendar (or other software).\nWe, the instructors, will conduct all individual communications using the University platforms of email, Canvas, Slack, or Piazza, with the caveat that we may use non-university platforms set up by students (such as GroupMe) only if they include all students in the class.\nThere will be no instructor-student private communications on any non-University platforms, such as social media, GroupMe, WhatsApp, etc.\nFor more information on resources for reporting sexual misconduct, please see the faculty senate best practices for faculty interactions and U-M’s page on Sexual and Gender-Based Misconduct."

Through striking juxtapositions of art and protest material, the exhibition asks visitors to consider how acts of dissent are built, communicated, and remembered.\nOpening in advance of the United States’ 250th anniversary, Ault offers a timely reflection on dissent as a cornerstone of American democracy and identity.\nhttps://umma.umich.edu/exhibitions/american-sampler-activating-the-archive/"

    "text": "“We seek to inform as well as to celebrate. The best posters about American workers and the jobs at which they labor make up a visually fascinating body of work that rewards our attention. The posters were produced with a dual purpose: to entertain and to inform. They were also vehicles for working people to present themselves visually, which is rarely as straightforward as it might seem because the labor force itself is not monolithic. Nor are the posters about just paid or wage labor. They repeatedly demonstrate that labor issues include both the workplace and the outside community and often portray families and neighbors, not just fellow workers.”–from Agitate! Educate! Organize!\nhttps://www.cornellpress.cornell.edu/labor-posters-with-a-message-of-equality/\nIn Agitate! Educate! Organize!, Lincoln Cushing and Timothy W. Drescher share their vast knowledge about the rich graphic tradition of labor posters. Lavish full-color reproductions of more than 250 of the best posters that have emerged from the American labor movement ensure that readers will want to return again and again to this visually fascinating treasury of little-known images from the American past. Some of the posters were issued by government programs and campaigns; some were devised by unions as recruiting tools or strike announcements; others were generated by grassroots organizations focused on a particular issue or group of workers–all reveal much about the diverse experiences of working people in the United States.American labor posters are widely scattered, difficult to locate, and rarely archived. Cushing and Drescher examined several thousand such images in the course their research, guaranteeing a truly representative selection. The presentation of the posters is thematic, with a brief history of activist graphic media followed by chapters on Dignity and Exploitation; Health and Safety; Women; Race and Civil Rights; War, Peace and Internationalism; Solidarity and Organizing; Strikes and Boycotts; Democracy, Voting, and Patriotism; History, Heroes, and Martyrs; and Culture. Along with the stunning color images, the text contributes to a much deeper understanding of the politics, history, artistry, and impact of this genre of activist art and the importance of the labor movement in the transformation of American society over the course of the twentieth century.

    "text": "Navigating a discussion-based course about politics can be challenging. People have strong opinions about politics. Some may have expertise in particular areas; sometimes, even those same people can feel overwhelmed in other conversations. My goal in this course is to provide you with conceptual tools, critical thinking skills, and models to help you better understand and participate in politics and policymaking. This will be most effective if we can create a “brave space” that allows each of you to participate “fully and truthfully”, take risks, and listen to and be empathetic toward one another.\nTo facilitate a productive seminar, we will start by thinking critically about the benefits and limitations of political civility and developing best practices for the semester.\n\nWhat have your most positive classroom experiences been (especially for discussion-based courses)? What made those experiences so positive, and how might that be recreated elsewhere?\nThink of a negative classroom experience you have had. What might the instructor, other students, and you have done differently to improve it?\nWhat worries you most about managing the course this term? Do you have ideas on how we might manage them?\nWhat might be the most effective strategies for managing dialogue across difference?\nAre there drawbacks to maintaining political civility?\n\nBrian Arao and Kristi Clemens suggest:\n\n“We argue that authentic learning about social justice often requires the very qualities of risk, difficulty, and controversy that are defined as incompatible with safety. These challenges are particularly unavoidable in participant groups composed of target and agent group members. In such settings, target and agent group members take risks by participating fully and truthfully, though these risks differ substantially by group membership and which identities hold the most salience for a given participant at a given time.”\n\nWe aim towards civility but also understand that civility has its limitations and can sometimes prevent honesty and true expressions of emotion and responsibility. Civility is also easier to achieve from a position of privilege. Nevertheless, I see that as a potentially productive tension, one which may help us all learn more as the semester progresses.\n\n\n\nThe professor commits to support student learning, including by:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStudents commit to practice active listening and engagement, including by:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo maintain successful and respectful relationships between students and the professor:"

We shape and are shaped by our context. Perceptions and practices of subjectivity and agency are learned. As Unger would say, the content of gender is up for grabs. Unger extends this, arguing that all forms of stability in the social world are mere “frozen politics” (12), “complicated and precarious settlements” (135) that could break loose at any time. Like Foucault, de Beauvoir, and others, Unger believes that we can study and theorize about the genealogy of institutions, social practices, and the objective nature of our subjectivity, situations, and potential alternatives. Apparent constants or similarities across institutions are usually the results of them being copied from elsewhere–reproduction and diffusion. There is no human nature (20). No proper order of emotions, virtues, or vices (25). “There are just too many ways to be human” (30). There are no necessary kinds of relations or forms of organization. No natural order or “natural law of human history” and no end (21). All social roles and forms of organization are up for grabs. The aim is to “free ourselves from a social script that both subordinates us unnecessarily to an over-powering scheme of class, communal, gender, and national divisions and denies us as individuals as groups, and as whole societies, a greater mastery over the institutional and imaginative contexts of our lives” (8).1\nUnger puts this in more direct conversation with Marx and Lukács, who also see the mind and society as an artifact. But, Unger argues, Marx, Lukács, and other deep-structure theorists fell into the trap of necessitarian thinking. By assuming (theorizing?) foundational superstructures and world-historical sequences, they failed to take the society-as-artifact insight all the way. “These theories repeatedly betrayed their understanding of society as an artifact by the fashion in which they turned this understanding into a concrete praxis of social explanation” (228).\n\nDoes de Beauvoir succeed in avoiding this kind of error?\n\nHow is this similar or different from Chakrabarty’s critique of explanatory narratives? Does Unger succeed in avoiding reification?\n\n“Those who have been converted to the idea of a transformative vocation cannot easily return to the notion of work as an honorable calling within a fixed scheme of social roles and hierarchies, nor can they remain content with a purely instrumental view of labor as a source of material benefits with which to support themselves and their families” (13).

Two key features of an institutional context are (1) “the degree to which a formative context can be challenged in the midst of ordinary social life…[and (2)] the relative disengagement of our practical and passionated dealings from a preexisting structure of roles and hierarchies” (173). Some institutional structures contain and inhibit change (mainly by limiting the imagination of alternative arrangements). Others build in features that foster their own reimagination and transformation. The upshot of plasticity is that it closes the gap between human longings and circumstances (18)."

He ironically calls these methods “super theory” and “ultra theory.” Super theory aims to use social science insights to advance a non-positivist theory of society, society as an artifact but one that can be studied and understood in limited, historically contingent ways that nevertheless point towards interventions that could transform it. Ultra theory also takes society as an artifact but rejects the attempt to develop any theoretical system. Ultra theory sounds like Hokenmeir and Adorno: relentless critique to undermine all claims to systematic theory.\nUnger sees ultra theory as a defensible approach but warns against falling into the same trap that positivists fall into in trying to find a firm ground for their critique. In my reading, Horkheimer and Adorno seem to avoid this trap. What do you think? Unger’s other concern about skeptical postmodern criticism is that it, like deep-structure theory, may deprive us of constructive insights.\nSuper-theory, conversely, is at risk of falling into the deep-theorist trap of assuming necessary structures of sequences in their effort to explain and make sense of the world.\n\n“When we reach toward general explanation, we often lapse back into deep-structure moves” (55).\n\nIf society is an artifact, if it is all politics, then no conceptual distinction can be foundational, no deep structure can be world-historical, and every configuration of institutions is distinct and contingent on a unique history of bargains."

    "section": "Totality and The Way Out",
    "text": "Totality and The Way Out\nBy keeping the context-routine distinction and abandoning discrete structures or sequences, Unger splits the totality in two (maybe others have done this, but Unger eschews citations, so it is hard to tell when he is borrowing). We are in a totality in the sense that received presuppositions inevitably influence our thinking. But “capitalism” is not a totality. It is many.1 The way out is not through (or at least not through any particular stages); it is to tinker with institutions in presupposition-undermining ways.2 The way out is by “doing things that cannot be dreamt of in the established mental or social world rather than by creating the world that could realize all dreams” (19).\n\n“The power to make society always goes beyond all the societies that exist or that have existed, just as the power to discover the truth about the world cannot keep within the forms of discourse that are its vehicles.” (21)\n\nUnger seems much more optimistic about our potential as “context-revising agents” (227 and elsewhere) than Horkheimer and Adorno. Both are interested in our imaginative potential to create something new, but Unger seems to see it happening in many more places than High Art.\n\n“Our beliefs about ideals and interests are shaped by the institutional and imaginative frameworks of social life. But they are not shaped completely…We regularly invest our recognized interests and ideals with ill-defined longings that we cannot satisfy within the limits imposed by our current institutional and imaginative assumptions.” (7)\n\nThe Subject’s objective nature is far from fully determined and seems to be highly available to anyone.\n\n“All our major problems in understanding of society arise from…the difficulty of accounting for the actions of a being who, individually and collectively, in thought and relationship, might break through the contexts within which he ordinarily moves. The truth of human freedom, of our strange freedom from any given finite structure, must count, count affirmatively, for the way we understand ourselves and our history.” (23-24)\n\nUnger seems aligned with Chakrabarty and others on the need for perspective (to “see the settled from the angle of the unsettled”) but does not give subaltern culture a special role. Perhaps this is because, for Unger, there is no essential “capitalism” and “outside”—only different configurations of institutions.3\nLike Chakrabarty and Adorno, different historical institutional configurations are pools of imaginative resources to be adapted and reconfigured—the raw material of society-making4—“the wealth of materials available for context-transforming use: the surviving residues of past institutional arrangements and imaginative worlds, the stubborn anomalies of a social order” (8).\nThere seems to be both a parallel and contradiction with Kojève here. Like Kojève, a formative context is a large collection of different kinds of presuppositions. However, for Unger, these components hang together accidentally and can be rearranged (though some forms of property organization do seem to be more compatible than others in Unger’s mind). The big difference is that Unger sees no end to history (21); there will always be struggles and changing practical and passionate relations (context revision). As a result, it seems that Unger is unconcerned with differentiation. Is this right?Unger would say “revolutionary reform,” but tinkering is a pretty good word for imaginative and experimental action aimed at transforming institutions, no?Can anyone can do this imaginative work? Or do some social stations predispose one to see the difference between context and routine and imagine alternatives?“economic capital, state power, practical knowledge, and accepted moral and social ideals” (34)–but this can’t be the full list, right?!?"

    "section": "Transformation without Revolution",
    "text": "Transformation without Revolution\nUnger emphasizes his commitment to the radical project and transformative change, but one of his argument’s real practical implications is that incrementalism can be transformative; no revolution is required. He downplays the incrementalism, calling it “revolutionary reform,” perhaps to avoid sounding like a reformist liberal tinkerer (which Unger is very sure he is not). Still, the potential for institutions to be changed is the linchpin of organizing strategy. In sharp contrast to Marxist claims about the necessity (strategically, theoretically, historically) of revolution, Unger argues that\n\n“The normal mode of transformative action is revolutionary reform, defined as the substitutions of any one of the loosely and unevenly connected arrangements and beliefs that go into the making of a formative context. A revolutionary reform changes the institutional and imaginative presuppositions taken for granted in the everyday struggles over the uses and mastery of the resources — of capital, governmental power, technical expertise, or legal and moral justification —that enable the occupants of some social status to set terms to what the occupants of other coastal stations do…Revolution becomes the limiting case of transformative action rather than the sole alternative to the statecraft of stability through tinkering.” (84, see also Chapter 7 starting on 150)\n\nConservative tinkering maintains institutions; imaginative tinkering sets things in motion. Unger often uses the example of changing the level of public control over the basic flows of investment decisions.\n\n“If industrial democracy is interpreted to mean a limited level of worker participation in business decisions, it may be accommodated without major disturbance to the established institutional and imaginative framework. Suppose, however, it is understood to require a shift in the basic form of capital allocation and control over investment decisions. It will then also shake up the imaginative vision that contrasts an area reserved for democratic principles with a realm governed by voluntary contract and technical hierarchy [in the current institutional context, not necessarily, of course].” (168)\n\nAnother good example of formative context, concretely defined in a realistic reform, is the right of incorporation (94).\nUnger believes that the false idea that revolution is required for transformative change is causing the left to miss opportunities, as do the purity tests of orthodoxy. “Experiments in thought and action were stifled by the fear that they might be viewed as an apostasy…a willful closure to the surprises of politics” (43-44). Furthermore, the unwarranted skepticism of institutional reform also leads to pessimism and demobilizing disillusionment with the practicability and the benefits of alternative forms of organization” (128). “False consciousness” is less of a problem than the suppression of imagination about alternatives, “assumptions about the possible and the real” that result from conflict being successfully contained and the current order winning a perceived “second-order necessity” (129). Indeed, in Unger’s telling, “false consciousness” rings false. There can be no “true” consciousness if consciousness is truly up for grabs.\nPositivists’ conflation of context and routine is even less imaginative and thus more dangerous—“their practice has a built-in propensity to take the existing framework of social life for granted and thereby to lend it a semblance of necessity and authority” (4).\nIn both cases, “superstition then encourages surrender.” (6) Belief in fate, lawlike forces, or an end of history holds back both the radical and liberal projects.\nOne example: why has universal suffrage not led to more redistribution of wealth, income, and power? Liberals think most people are happy enough with the current arrangement. Marxists think the proletariat has a false consciousness. Unger thinks that both are failing to imagine alternative social orders that could advance their programs; even when we have the power to redistribute wealth, we are taking inherited systems for granted, perceiving them as more natural/necessary than they are, and thus failing to believe in—and thus failing to invent—new forms of organization.

Unger frames his project as both a fundamental rethinking (13)—a “radical alternative to Marxism” (227)—and a friendly “effort to correct and unify the radical project” (14) that is easily compatible with Marxian thought. How big of a change is required? How important are discrete structures and deterministic stages to modern Marxism/Marxianism?1\nWhy discrete structures and stages might be important\nMost importantly for praxis (and perhaps theory), discrete stages imply a totality that must be totally remade. Unger’s approach allows incrementalism and change from within, while the orthodoxy that Unger seems to correctly describe requires total revolution.\n\n“Stages” language permeates Marxist praxis. We are told we are in “late-stage” capitalism.2 The solution is the “communist” stage.\n\nWhy discrete structures and stages might not be so important\n\nThe idea of Communism in one country, communist participation in party politics, and more seem to suggest that Marxists believe that incremental change is possible. Indeed, modern communists seem more Ungerian than accelerationist. As Unger says, “Hopefully, democrats everywhere follow closely any sign of a social experiment, any place on earth, hoping that it may reveal something about the unexplored opportunities for the advancement of the radical project.” (57) Maybe radicals are open to experiments and marginal gains after all?\nDespite all of their bomb-throwing, Hokenmeir and Adorno hint that all is not hopeless; there are marginal ways that artists can still make something new. We are not totally trapped. And to the extent that we are not totally trapped, there seems to be room for Unger’s transformative incrementalism.\n\nHow would Marx and Lukács respond to Unger?\nUnger tries to preempt this critique on 57-60. Does he correctly characterize modern Marxian thought?Is Unger persuasive that “capitalism” is incoherent (46-53)? Is this a more persuasive critique of capitalism as a stage than as a formation? If most people are not employed by for-profit organizations (e.g., Ann Arbor, Cambridge, Madison, etc.), do we live in a capitalist society or not?"

    "text": "3. Is Unger vulnerable to his own critiques?\nUnger acknowledges that his project risks falling into the deep-structure theorists’ trap of asserting general patterns. Unger frequently describes “the” features or differences in society in ways that seem to transcend the particular cases he is discussing—he is building theory after all.\nWhere is the line between inappropriately deep theory and appropriate modeling of observed social facts and relationships? In my mind, theory should generalize beyond the case. Unger’s argument against closed lists is persuasive (every empirical coding scheme I have used includes an “other” category). The particular critique of deterministic stages is also persuasive, but patterns of cause and effect seem essential. At some point, we must say that x tends to lead to y, in theory, recognizing that our theory may be incomplete and our inferences contingent on external validity (the jump from what we observe to a broader claim).\nMore broadly, if everything is politics, this must include everything Unger says about theory. Super-theory and ultra-theory are not a closed list of possible ways out.  Unger narrates history as a contingent and unique “haphazard and hodgepodge process” (135), free from necessary forms and stages. However, we may still get suspicious whenever he makes a general claim. For example, “decentralization” and “the market form of economic order” (96 and elsewhere) and “industrial style” (103) seem to have some real substantive content for Unger. Does Unger fall into the deep-structure theorist’s necessitarian thinking at times? Unger critiques Marxist reification of the market (111-113) and argues extensively that property and contract are always compromises1. Do abstract assumptions still lurk between the lines?2 Unger attempts to preempt this kind of anxiety:\n\n“The answer, in a nutshell, has two parts: our concerns are not as unique as our situations, and our situations, in an age of partial emancipation from false necessity, enable us to treat anything proposed or tried out in one place as potentially applicable, with adjustments, everywhere else.” (136)\n\nIs it satisfying?\nContract theory is irrelevant! Except that it occupies conceptual ground on which alternative market orders could be developed (120-121).Of course they do! “truth about the world cannot keep within the forms of discourse that are its vehicles.”"

    "text": "4. What is left for theory?\nIf Marxians are wrong to model deep structure (“macro foundations”) discreetly, are game theorists similarly wrong to model “micro-foundations” discretely?1\nUnger’s “theory” — his “style of generalizing explanation” (60) — seems to be a little ad hoc. He frames it as a grand constructive project, but in practice, the result is a mix of explanations like “See! It could have gone either way,” “What seems like an essential form is just diffusion,” and “Here are some lessons from my re-telling of a particular historical episode.” Maybe this is what a social theory move against general social laws must be.\nTo use his own words, there is no “unrevisable and self-authenticating” truth; instead, we have understanding and insight. Science can only be a “process of self-correction…objectivity through maximum corrigibility” (27). Unger claims that this does not prejudice the possibility of cumulative insight but supplies us instead with a more modest and realistic version of objectivity—the assurance of not being definitively and completely imprisoned by whatever basic assumptions we happen to have inherited” (29); the objective nature of our subjectivity.\n\n“For Peirce, the scientific basis of objectivity in science became the gradual convergence of scientific opinion toward a final opinion…You can say the same, though with less assurance, of Hegel’s idea of absolute insight. For, though we can interpret this idea as completed and unconditional knowledge, we can also read it as an ideal limit, never actually reached. It is the affirmative mirror image of the negative, cumulative practice of context smashing.” (29)\n\nDifficult ground on which to construct social theory!\nUnger’s critique of economists (63-71) implies that it must either abandon normative and descriptive debates and become pure analytic tool-making or pursue a theory like Unger’s—public choice economics is incoherent statecraft."

    "text": "Is Unger a Bayesian Social Scientist?\nIn empirical models, we often say that \\(\\beta\\) represents the average effect of X on Y, all else equal, recognizing that we do not know what else exists. There is noise. There is error. There is happenstance. But probabilistic relationships, we say, can be uncovered. Is this the kind of theorizing Unger means? It seems on some level incompatible, but, and the same time, Unger consistently uses phrases like “tends to,” “is closely connected with,” and “is more likely to” throughout the book.\nIf Unger aims to draw non-positivist understandings from social science, he may have comrades in the Bayesians who see science as less about uncovering hidden truths and more about updating our understandings. Everything is contingent beliefs and uncertain probabilistic relationships. Bayesian statisticians believe that understanding is a combination of prior beliefs and observation. Do presuppositions present a problem for this kind of reasoning? Unger seems to want us to downweight our prior beliefs of what is possible. This is a good strategy for more clearly aligning prediction with observation, but it may not the best way to estimate the possible.\nGiven the arbitrary nature of prior belief, is there room for faith (strong priors) in imagined forms of organization beyond what we see? Should we, in a sense, all else equal, dare to assume that desired worlds are possible when the world we observe tells us little? Is this a reasonable interpretation of what it means to substitute “beliefs that go into the making of a formative context”? Is imagination purely generative, or can we believe in things that we imagine?"

    "text": "Context-preserving Preserving Quarrels vs. Context-disturbing Struggles.\nUnger is clear that there is a categorical distinction between context-preserving and disturbing conflict (72-79). To be sure, it is a knife-edge distinction in practice. One can quickly turn into the other. However, he also uses the language of scale: “context-preserving quarrels so rarely grow into context-disturbing struggles” (129). Is there a difference in scale, or would Unger just as well have said “change” into context-disturbing struggles and saved me this confusion? On the one hand, we might say that context-transforming is big, necessarily bigger. On the other hand, the incremental steps to leading in a transformative direction depend not on the size of the step but on their cumulative direction. Indeed, “the positivist social scientist…cannot recognize the nature and extent of its transformative promise”. Yet, “The subjective sign of escalation is the growing intensity of the fighting” (169)—is this always the case for transformative change?\nDrawing a parallel to more empirical scholarship on policy change, Baumgartner and Jones offer a similar account to Unger, focusing more on the scale of change than the context-routine distinction. Like Unger, they observe that policy changes in fits and starts with periods of stability. Drawing on evolutionary theory, they call this pattern Punctuated Equilibrium, arguing that societal interests strike bargains, forming a “policy monopoly” that suppresses conflict and leads to stability until some (usually external) perturbation forces new issue frames to the discourse and groups to strike new bargains. The new ideas and alignments cause new policies.\nThe punctuated equilibrium framework was critiqued and extended by Cashore and Howlett, building on Durant and Diehl, who show that transformative policy change can occur in many deceptively small cumulative moves. Furthermore, what may often appear to be transformative change may be quickly reversed—they call this “faux paradigmatic” change. The latter may clearly result from reactionary moves or incorporationist dialectic. I am most interested in what Unger and we make of the former critique that small cumulative changes can be transformative.\nWe might also bring in other political concepts, including “policy drift” and “policy feedback” to Unger’s discussion of “cumulative change” (77) and “policy diffusion” to institutional patterns that appear to be staged but turn out to be “a cut-and-paste job” (125) or “follow-the-leader sequence” (154)."

    "text": "The Program: Is Unger Simply Not a Communist?\n\nHow far does it get us to imagine a Marxian social science that lacks a commitment to communism? Is it this? Unger wants to free the definition of the radical project from its assumptions about the possible forms of organization (80). If you don’t assume that the goal of praxis is Communism (or perhaps you do assume it is radical petty-bourgeoise democracy), is Unger basically where you land?1 Does his apparent attachment to petty-bourgeois formations color his analysis, or is it as derivative as he makes it out to be?  For example, if a group is committed to “a narrow conception of transformative possibilities” and thus “maintains the purity of its radical views at the cost of increasing difficulty in winning or maintaining electoral majorities,” does Unger’s critique still have value? How much of the practical value of this critique depends on being open to alternatives to communism?\nTo back up a step, Unger appears to land on petty-bourgeois strategies for organizing production because of his desire to break down task-defining and task-executing roles. The breaking down of predefined roles is emancipation.2 In addition to advancing freedom, liberation from presupposed roles and hierarchies can unleash productive potential.3 “Plasticity” is a “requirement” that must be “satisfied” (217-223). Decentralization, institutionalized political mobilization, self-organization of civil society, and other practical aims do seem to follow from Unger’s commitment to plasticity as a means of emancipation, but he must admit at every turn that they are not the only way. We should be able to imagine others, right? Again, do we buy that the program falls out of the theory?\nKojève, for example, also engaged in Marxian thought without a commitment to communism, but he was more invested in deep structure and less invested in social science.“The leading role of artisans, skilled workers, and small-scale producers and professionals and of the advocates of small-scale and cooperative enterprises in challenging the emergent dominant order of the modern West” (63). Also, see 110 & Chapter 12.For example, see how the productive requirements of war destroy social roles. (184-204)."
